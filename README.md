# BWI-coding-challange
BWI made a coding challange. This is my solution

On a previos coding challange I got the critic that I am not using object orientated programming enogth
and that I don't add a description to my functions.

I used the critic to improve my coding style. I started using object orientated progamming as much as possible 
and also start liking it a lot. I started adding a descriptions to my functions. 

I am still open to constructive critic and ways to improve my coding style.

The task was to fill up a two trucks in the most efficient way with some items. Each item has a weight and a score. 
The goal was to get the biggest score from the load in the truck while not passing the maximum vehicle load capacity.
